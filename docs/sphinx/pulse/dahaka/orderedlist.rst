Oredered List
===============

.. note::
  Although this, like :doc:`chain`, could use an XOR link to enable 
  space-saving bidirectional iteration it was decided that A) It was 
  unneeded as only single direction iteration is required and B) By
  not using XOR links, the debugger can be of more use.
